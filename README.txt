Evolutionary Computation Assignment 1: Group 10


Instruction: To run the file type "python3 main.py". This will run it for all exercise's. If a specific exercise is wanted to be run, comment out all code in main that is not related to the specific exercise as labelled in the code. If a specific combination of selection, recombination and mutation is wanted to be run, type "geneticAlgorithm.run(20000, numberofPopulation, datasets[j],"{SELECTION}", "{RECOMBINATION}", "{MUTATION}") into main, in which:

Selection:
fitnessProportional= Fitness Proportional Selection 
tournamentSelection= Tournament Selection 
elitismSelection= Elitism Selection

Crossover:
edgeRecomb= Edge Recombination Selection 
orderCrossover= Order Crossover
PMXCrossover= PMX Crossover
cycleCrossover= Cycle Crossover

Mutation:
scrambleMutation= Scramble Mutation
insertMutation= Insert Mutation
swapMutation= Swap Mutation
inversionMutation= Inversion Mutation
